# MLE-with-Bayesian-Classification-and-KNN-for-Fashion-MNIST

Given a Fashion-MNIST dataset of 28 x 28 pixel grayscale images in a training set of these 60,000 thousand images belonging to 10 classes, and the testing set consists of 10,000 images.
Using Maximum Likelihood followed by Bayesian rule for classification and Nearest neighbor rule classifier, the data is classified into its respective classes.
Considering the high dimensional data, PCA and LDA methods are applied for dimensionality reduction and accuracy is checked.
The entire project is programmed in Python.
